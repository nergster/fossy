# Fossy
**Fossy is...**
Well, it doesn't really know what it is. But it's alive now, that's for sure. It can do things, like move, eat, and sleep. It can interact with it's environment. It can **create**.

But it's not all rainbows and butterflies. Fossy's world is beautiful but mysterious, plentiful but dangerous. To survive, it will take more than just being alive.

But not to fear, Fossy is not alone in this world. There are bountiful creatures in this world, each with their own incredible abilities and talents. And just maybe, with a common goal and a dash of trust, you can help each other achieve more than you ever could alone.

Journey on a path of self-discovery through a procedural open world of ancient natural beauty, a unique virtual ecosystem where anything is possible. Find friends in creatures with common goals, and work together to keep each other alive and safe. But watch out! Unspeakable dangers lurk in the night, And failing to find shelter could mean the end of your journey...

## Overview
Fossy is a project that aims to showcase the power of open-source development in the gaming industry. The game itself teaches the core lesson of free and open source, and the reason behind the project: "Teamwork makes the dream work". There is always someone with common interests and goals, but everyone has different talents and specialties. When we complement each other by contributing to the group, we can get so much farther together than we ever could apart.

Technically, the end goal for the project is to get a contributor who is attracted to the project by the game itself, instead of the GitHub or website. They enjoy playing the game, and want to help out in it's development. Of course, we need a playerbase first, and so the goal right now is to publish a stable `0.1.0` release as an early access game on Steam.

But, Just like Fossy, I can't do this alone. I need **YOU**! You have talents that are different than mine, which means anything you do to help, you are doing better than me. If this project sounds exciting, I encourage you to help! Follow the instructions [below](#running-the-game) to download and play the game, then come back here to the [Issues](https://github.com/nergster/fossy/issues) page to suggest changes or improvements to the game.

## Download the game

I don't have CI/CD checks or nightly build artifacts set up yet, and there are no releases until the betas, so you currently have to [build from source](#build-the-game).
