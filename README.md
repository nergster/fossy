## Use this template
1. Click the `Use this template button`, then create a new repository while making sure to select the option to include all branches. Additionally, be sure to check the owner of the repository, either an organization or an individual, depending on your needs.
    * The template contains a main and a dev branch, issue and pull request templates, and a workflow file, to help you quickly get started on your project.

## Initial setups

#### Project board
2. Copy a project board from https://github.com/users/LeDuble/projects/8 and click the three dots in the top right, and select "Make a Copy". 
    * Make sure to verify that the owner of the project is going correct before proceeding, either an organization or an individual.
    * This project board contains all the necessary settings, so no additional configuration is needed.
    * Link it to your repository through the Projects tab in your repository.

#### Labels
3. Add labels to your organization or repository as described here: <a href="https://github.com/LeDuble/Git-Etiquette#labe">The labels for issues (Git Etiquette)</a>

#### Workflow file setup
4. select the workflow file that you are going to use
* If you are planning to use this workflow within your organization, keep the `WFprojects_organization_version.yaml` file and delete the `WFprojects.yml` file. If you are planning to use it as an individual, do the opposite.

5. Read the <a href="https://github.com/LeDuble/Git-Etiquette#wfile">documentation (Git Etiquette)</a> to learn how to configure the workflow file.
* If the setup has already been done, you can proceed to the next step which is configuring the values. Read more at <a href="https://github.com/LeDuble/Git-Etiquette#editing-the-parameters-in-wfprojectsyml-file">here</a>
    * If the app has already been installed to your organization and the required secret variables have been added, all you need to do is update the values of the `organization_name` and `project_number` (<a href="https://github.com/LeDuble/Git-Etiquette#finding-number-of-project-board">see: how to find project number</a>).
